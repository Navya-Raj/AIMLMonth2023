Summary(Optional) :   In this project, I aimed to predict the diagnosis of hepatitis C based on clinical and demographic features. We performed data analysis and preprocessing                        tasks, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and identifying outliers. We explored the correlations between features and the                        hepatitis C diagnosis and observed strong dependencies. We also analyzed the distribution of diagnosis categories and identified imbalances that could                           impact the classification task. Overall, this project involved comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling to develop a predictive model                         for hepatitis C diagnosis.
